## Tech Stack
- The site uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the runtime environment and web framework respectively.
- We used [React](https://reactjs.org/) as our web framework to finally display all of our data.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), along with [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) are used to store and validator users.
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) is used for file uploads to the database.
- [Tesseract.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tesseract.js/v/2.1.1) is used for OCR recognition of reports for the Corto Companion.
- And a lot of other miscellaneous libraries and packages that helped us build the site
